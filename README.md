# Churn Predictor Pro

Final project of IBM's course https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python on coursera

### Aim of the project is to predict customer churn.

A simple comparison between KNN,SVM,Decision Tree and Logistic Regression models on a given data set of loans records.
final results:
