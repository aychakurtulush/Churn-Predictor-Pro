# Churn Predictor Pro

Final project of IBM's course https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python on coursera

Churn Predictor Pro is an innovative machine learning application that utilizes various techniques, including logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines, to analyze customer data and predict churn. The project is designed to provide businesses and researchers with a powerful tool for understanding customer behavior and improving customer retention.

One of the key features of Churn Predictor Pro is its user-friendly interface, which allows users to input customer data and receive real-time predictions about churn. The web application includes data analysis tools and visualizations to help users better understand the results and underlying data.

Built using Python and IBM Watson Studio tools, including IBM Cloud Object Storage, IBM Watson Machine Learning, and IBM Watson Studio, Churn Predictor Pro is a well-documented open-source project that allows other researchers and developers to modify the code for their specific needs.

### Overall, Churn Predictor Pro is a reliable and professional machine learning application that provides businesses with valuable insights into customer behavior, helping them to improve customer retention and reduce churn rates.
